## 📋 To-Do App

## Overview:

To-Do App is a simple task management application built with vanilla JavaScript. Users can create, complete, and remove tasks through an intuitive interface. The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing UI state in a small but complete application.

## Features:

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Remove tasks from the list

Clean and minimal user interface

Instant UI updates based on user actions

## Tech Stack:

HTML5 – semantic markup

CSS3 – layout and styling

JavaScript (ES6) – application logic

## How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/baconlord102/todo-app.git

Navigate into the project directory

Open index.html in your browser

No dependencies or build steps required.

## Application Logic:

Tasks are created via form input and rendered dynamically

Event listeners handle task completion and deletion

UI state is updated directly through DOM manipulation

The application operates entirely on the client side

## What This Project Demonstrates:

DOM traversal and manipulation

Event-driven programming

Managing UI state without external libraries

Clean separation of structure, style, and logic

## Future Improvements:

Persist tasks using localStorage

Add task editing functionality

Implement task filtering (active/completed)

Improve accessibility and keyboard support

## Purpose:

This project was built to reinforce JavaScript fundamentals by implementing a commonly understood application in a clean, maintainable way.
